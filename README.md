## VUTTR (Very Useful Tools to Remember)

I had found this challenge on the internet. This app is a simple repository to manage the very useful tools.
The link is below:
https://www.notion.so/Back-end-0b2c45f1a00e4a849eefe3b1d57f23c6
### Technologies
- Java version 15.0.2 
- Springboot v2.5.4
- h2database
- Lombok 1.18.20
- springfox 3.0.0 (Swagger)

### Challenge Requirements
- 0: The API port should be 3000 
- 1: A route that returns the list with all tools

  ```
  GET /tools
  ```
- 2: Get the tools filtering by tag

    ```
    GET /tools?tag=node
    ```
    
- 3: The request body must contain the information of the tool to be registered, without the ID (automatically generated by the server). 
The response, in case of success, must be the same object, with its new ID generated.
    ```
    POST /tools
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```
    ```
  "title": "hotel",
  "link": "https://github.com/typicode/hotel",
  "description": "Local app manager. Start apps within your browser, developer tool with local .localhost domain and https out of the box.",
  "tags":["node", "organizing", "webapps", "domain", "developer", "https", "proxy"]
    ```
- 4: The user should be able to delete a tool by ID number
    ```
    DELETE /tools/:id
    ```
